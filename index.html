            <p>Many people want to know the story or the ending of the K-dramas. 
				And here, I will recount a long story about Descendants of the Sun, the most popular Korean drama in 2016. </p>
			<p><mark>Descendants of the Sun tell about the love story of a special forces captain, Yoo Si jin and a surgeon, Kang Mo yeon.</mark> 
				Si jin is the captain of the alpha team who is always assigned to keep the peace and Mo yeon is a smart and beautiful doctor. 
				The alpha team consists of 5 people who have a call sign, namely Big Boss (Yoo Si jin), Wolf (Seo Dae young), Snoopy, Harry Potter, and Piccolo. </p>
			<p>At the beginning of the story, Si jin and his team rescue hostages from the North Korean Special Forces. 
				During their day off, Si jin and Dae young catch a motorcycle thief, Kim Gi beom. 
				The injured Gi beom is sent to Haesung Hospital, where Mo yeon works. 
				When Dae young realizes his cell phone was stolen by Kim Gi beom, Si jin and Dae young go to Haesung Hospital to retrieve it. </p>
			<p>At Haesung Hospital, Si jin and Mo yeon meet for the first time. 
				Si jin falls in love with Mo yeon at first sight and tries to get her attention. 
				But Mo yeon thinks of him as a criminal gang because he has a call sign “Big Boss”. 
				Si jin can solve the misunderstanding with CCTV footage. </p>
			<p>After that, Si jin asks Mo yeon to treat a gunshot wound on the left side of his stomach. 
				Mo yeon takes care of him and suggests cleaning the wound every day. 
				Si jin also makes an appointment with Mo yeon so he can meet Mo yeon again. 
				Si jin and Mo yeon begin to date. 
				Little by little, Mo yeon became interested in Si jin. </p>
			<p>But due to Si jin keeps getting called to duty when he’s with Mo yeon, their dates are interrupted halfway. 
				When Si jin returns and meets Mo yeon again, Mo yeon asks him to explain his sudden disappearances and his job, but he is unable to go into too much because of the very confidential nature of his assignment. 
				The two realize that they have conflicting views about human life. Si jin, as a soldier, will kill to protect lives while Mo yeon, as a doctor, has to save lives at all costs. 
				They decide to break off their budding relationship. 
				After that, Si jin is deployed on a peacekeeping mission in the fictional war-torn country of Urk. </p>
			<p>8 months later, Mo yeon becomes a celebrity TV doctor and caring for VIP patients at the hospital. 
				But because she refuses the sexual advances of the hospital chairman, she is picked to lead a medical team to staff a medicube in Urk. 
				And there, Mo yeon meet Si jin again. In Urk, Si jin wants to reconnect with Mo yeon. 
				In there, Mo yeon has to save the life of a VIP patient by operating on him with little chance of survival. 
				But if that patient dies, there will be war. Si jin makes a risky decision to protect and order Mo yeon’s team to operate on a VIP patient so that his life can be saved. 
				Because of Si jin’s choice, Si jin and Dae young’s return to South Korea is hastened. 
				And because of his hasty return, Si jin wants an answer about Mo yeon’s feelings for him. 
				Because Mo yeon still hesitates whether she was ready to be the lover of a dangerous but also attractive man, she rejects Si jin. </p>
			<p>When Si jin has returned to South Korea and Mo yeon will return, there is an earthquake in Urk. 
				So, Si jin and Dae young back to Urk to help the people there. The soldiers and the medical team work together to save workers in the collapsed building. 
				Si jin and Mo yeon meet again and Si jin ties Mo yeon’s shoelaces. In the end, they save a lot of people. 
				While in Urk, Mo yeon accidentally confesses her feelings and then, the two officially start dating.</p>
			<p>One day when a viral epidemic in Urk, Mo yeon is kinapped by Argus, the former delta team captain. 
				Si Jin wants to save Mo Yeon, but Argus has a lot of strong troops. So, Argus uses Si Jin to he can escape from the CIA. 
				Instead of helping Argus escape, Si Jin saves Mo Yeon and kills Argus. </p>
			<p>After returning to Korea, Si jin and Mo yeon continue their relationship. 
				Later, Mo yeon plans to leave Haesung Hospital and open her own clinic. 
				Unfortunately, the bank doesn't want to provide a loan if Mo yeon is unemployed, so Mo yeon is forced to keep working at Haesung Hospital. 
				Meanwhile, Si jin is involved in South Korea's peace action with North Korea. 
				When Si jin and the Alpha Team are sent to Albania on their next mission, Si jin is lost in an explosion and is assumed to be dead. Mo yeon is devastated. </p>
			<p>One year later, Mo yeon go to Albania to commemorate Si jin's death as well as volunteer activities. 
				Suddenly Si jin arrives with injuries and tells her that he is rescued from captivity by "a friend from afar" a soldier from North Korea whom Si jin had helped before, helping him stay alive. 
				Finally, Si jin and Mo yeon reunite.</p>
